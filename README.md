1. Project Overview:
This is a simple Login Application built using Java Servlets and JSP. It validates user credentials and redirects authenticated users to a welcome page while showing error messages for invalid inputs.

2. Technology Stack:

Backend: Java Servlet (LoginServlet3)
Frontend: JSP (login2.jsp, welcome.jsp)
Server: Apache Tomcat (Servlet 3.1+)
Configuration: web.xml for servlet mapping and welcome page setup

3. Setup & Deployment:

Place login2.jsp and welcome.jsp inside WebContent/ or src/main/webapp/.
Ensure web.xml is correctly configured for Servlet 3.1+ (or adjust for older versions).
Run on Tomcat after cleaning and redeploying the project.
